2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <project_directory>
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    (Assuming a `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` exists. The `Pipfile` was listed in `ls()` output)
    ```bash
    pip install pipenv  # If using Pipfile
    pipenv install
    # or
    pip install -r requirements.txt # If using requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Apply migrations:**
