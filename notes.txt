use this commands initially-1)pip install pipenv
2)pipenv shell it will create the virtual environment
3)pipenv --venv -it shows the virtual environment your currently running
4)normal create project after that go to the view in that command palette in that select the projectname environment at the full right there will pipenv select that one not the global
5)for the new environment always install the django once 
6)pip install mysqlclient
//for the upload of the image in the upload folder and the file name see the below example
Let's break down the logic behind the getFileName function and its usage in the Image field of the Category model:

What Happens in getFileName Function
The getFileName function is designed to generate a unique filename for each uploaded file by appending the current timestamp to the original filename. Hereâ€™s what each part does:

Generate Current Time:

python
Copy code
now_time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d%H:%M:%S")
This line fetches the current date and time and formats it into a string like 202412061234:56 (year, month, day, hour, minute, and second).
It ensures that the filename will include the precise timestamp of when the file was uploaded.
Create New Filename:

python
Copy code
new_filename = "%s%s" % (now_time, filename)
The original filename (filename) is concatenated with the timestamp (now_time).
For example, if the original filename is test.jpg, and the timestamp is 202412061234:56, the new filename becomes 202412061234:56test.jpg.
Return the File Path:

python
Copy code
return os.path.join('uploads/', new_filename)
os.path.join ensures the new filename is placed inside the uploads/ folder. The final output will look like:
makefile
Copy code
uploads/202412061234:56test.jpg
This specifies where the file should be stored relative to the media directory.
How It Works in the Category Model
The Image field in the Category model uses this function to handle file uploads:

python
Copy code
Image = models.ImageField(upload_to=getFileName, null=True, blank=True)
ImageField with upload_to:

The upload_to argument tells Django how to generate the file path for storing uploaded images.
Instead of using a fixed folder, it dynamically calls the getFileName function to create a unique path for every file.
Uploads Folder:

The uploaded images will be stored in a folder named uploads/ in the media directory of your Django project.
For example, if your media directory is configured as media/, the final path of an uploaded image might be:
bash
Copy code
media/uploads/202412061234:56test.jpg
File Overwriting Prevention:

Adding a timestamp ensures that no two files will have the same name, even if they are uploaded with identical filenames (e.g., test.jpg).
Without this, uploading a file with the same name would overwrite the previous one.
Key Benefits of This Approach
Uniqueness: Ensures filenames are unique, preventing overwriting issues.
Organization: Keeps all uploaded files neatly stored in a designated folder (uploads/).
Dynamic Handling: The getFileName function dynamically constructs the path, making it versatile for various use cases.
Where Is the File Stored?
Django saves the uploaded file relative to the MEDIA_ROOT directory specified in your settings.py file:
python
Copy code
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
If MEDIA_ROOT is set to BASE_DIR / 'media', and you upload an image named test.jpg at 2024-12-06 12:34:56, the final storage location will be:
bash
Copy code
/path/to/your/project/media/uploads/202412061234:56test.jpg
